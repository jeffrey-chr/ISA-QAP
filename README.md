# ISA-QAP
Instance space analysis of the Quadratic Assignment Problem

You don't have to clone this repository; if you clone the submodule repositories, copy the "Utilities" folder, 
and set up a few config files then everything will work fine. 

If you do clone this repository:

Step 1 - Get whatever submodules you need.

InstanceGeneration and Features are dependent on the Utilities folder.
Algorithms will compile on its own but to do anything useful with it you will require some QAP instance data files like those in the Instances folder.

Step 2 - Run configure.bat (Windows) or configure.bash (Linux) to set up the config files automatically.

The contents of the ISA and Algorithms submodules is largely not my work. See their respective READMEs for authorship and licencing details.
